# Mental Distress in Expecting Parents: Detecting Anxiety and Depression in Pregnancy-Related Reddit Posts

## About the Project

This was a personal machine learning project conducted in **May 2025** to learn more about natural language processing.

In this project, we seek to explore whether thoughts and behaviors related to anxiety and depression are prevalent in pregnancy-related posts on Reddit. It uses the dataset from the study of [Dhankar & Katz (2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10684261/), which extracted Reddit posts from pregnancy- and mental health-related subreddits. It was conducted in **Python**, using libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` to analyze and visualize data, and `sklearn` and `torch` to perform the machine learning methodologies.
