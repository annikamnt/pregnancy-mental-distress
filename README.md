# Mental Distress in Expecting Parents: Detecting Anxiety and Depression in Pregnancy-Related Reddit Posts

## About the Project

This was a personal machine learning project conducted in **May 2025** to learn more about natural language processing.

In this project, we seek to explore whether thoughts and behaviors related to anxiety and depression are prevalent in pregnancy-related posts on Reddit. It uses the dataset from the study of [Dhankar & Katz (2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10684261/), which extracted Reddit posts from pregnancy- and mental health-related subreddits. It was conducted in **Python**, using libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` to analyze and visualize data, and `sklearn` and `torch` to perform the machine learning methodologies.

## Instructions

In running the Jupyter notebook for the first time, please conduct the following preliminaries:
1. Download the dataset from the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/w45nr/files/osfstorage?view_only=).
2. Install all the relevant libraries, which can be found in the first block of code in the Jupyter notebook.
3. For the BERT model, fit the data to the model by setting `retrain = True`. For subsequent runs, set `retrain = False` to evaluate the model and make predictions.
